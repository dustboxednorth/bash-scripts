# Public bash/general Linux scripts
Some bash scripts I've made for your public consoompshun! 
Kind of skimpy as of writing, but you get the point :-)

Cowfiles are stored in `/usr/share/cowsay/cows/`.

To add cowfiles:

`sudo mv /path/to/cowfile /usr/share/cowsay/cows/`

*(note: dustboxed-eyescompat.cow provides functionality for cowsay's "eyes" feature)*
